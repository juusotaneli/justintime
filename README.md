JIT app is on [Heroku](https://justintime-app.herokuapp.com/)

## How to use

Using JIT-app is very simple - just navigate to Heroku and see the public transport options between my home and my (hopefully) soon-to-be summer work place.
JIT-app uses GraphQL to fetch the Itinerary data from HSLÂ´s GraphQL-API. Displayed itineraries are updated every 5 minutes.
